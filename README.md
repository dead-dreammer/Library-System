The Resource class serves as a base for different types of resources, with derived classes for Books, Journals, and Digital resources. The Catalog class handles the storage and management of these resources, allowing operations like adding a new resource, removing a resource by ISBN, and searching for resources by title, author, or ISBN. It also generates a report grouping resources by their type. The program interacts with the user through a menu, offering choices to perform these actions and manage the catalog effectively.
